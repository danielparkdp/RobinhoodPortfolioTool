# RobinhoodPortfolioTool
Program for building and analyzing an investment portfolio (risk hedging, options, stock positions) and initial predictive model for everyday investors. Components are intended to mirror what is offered in the Robinhood app (made extensible so if more derivatives/options, etc. are added to the app, can be added to the tool).
